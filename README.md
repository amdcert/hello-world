# hello-world
My first GitHub repository to help me get started

I have worked in Project Management for the past 4 years, primarily supporting software development research and development projects. I am starting to take steps to increase my own knowledge of software development practices with 2 primary goals; 1. I would like to make myself a better Project Manager. I hope that having a greater knowledge of coding and general coding practices will assist with this, and 2. I would like to start coding for my own purposes while in my spare time.
